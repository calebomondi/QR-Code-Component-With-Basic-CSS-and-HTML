## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

We can use css transformations to center an element at the center of the page both vertically and horizontally.

```css
.container {
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
  transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
}
```
### Useful resources

- [main resource](https://www.w3schools.com) - I learnt how to use transformations to center an element both vertically and horizontally. I will still use this site for other projects as it is very informative.
